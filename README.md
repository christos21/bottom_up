# BUMP: Smart Grid Bottom-up Modelling and Power-flow Analysis

This project is a bottom-up modelling approach of a smart grid. A smart grid, 
consisting of multiple households, is simulated and a power flow analysis 
is applied for a period up to a week.  Furthermore, multiple end-user and grid 
related indexes are calculated in order to evaluate the utilization of photovoltaic 
(PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). 
Finally, the PV and BESS penetration in a smart grid are tested for potential 
over-voltage or thermal violation issues.
